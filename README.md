## Open Source Learning Notes

This repository documents my journey of understanding real-world open-source projects,
primarily in the React and frontend ecosystem.

The goal is to:
- Read production-grade codebases
- Understand architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Learn how maintainers think and review changes
- Prepare myself to contribute meaningfully to open source

### How I use this repo
- Notes are written in my own words
- Focus is on *why* something exists, not just *how*
- Includes references to issues, PRs, and discussions when relevant

### Areas of focus
- React internals and ecosystem libraries
- State management patterns
- Performance and re-render optimization
- API design and developer experience

This repo is a learning artifact, not a tutorial.
